I attended Flatiron School from August 2017 to Febuary 2018 where I learned several technologies but focused mainly in Ruby on Rails. I fell in love with it but, looking at where the job market was, I felt that I needed to learn Java to be the most marketable developer I could be. I enrolled at UCSD Java Programming certificate program. Because Ruby and Java are both strongly typed and Object Oriented, I enjoyed it initially but that soon faded into annoyance. 

Ruby has a very clean synax that makes it easy to read and understand, especially from someone on the outside looking in. Java on the other hand is extremely messy and verbose. Ruby also provides a large library of gems that makes. There are also ORMs, Frameworks, and CLI tools. You are mostly on your own with Java. Although Java is widely used for backend development, you will not find a better language than ruby for web development, mainly because of the aforementioned frameworks like Rails and Sinatra. Ruby is a great Object Oriented language without all the deep details of other languages like Java. I spoke with a Java developer who contended that the verbosity of Java is a positive because it gives the user complete control of every little detail of the code. That is definitely true as it compares to Ruby but this blog is for those that are new to programming. Ruby is the clear winner.
