Growing up I would complain to my mother about how behind we were, living in Louisiana. If the new Playstation came out in December of 2002, it would show up in our local Walmart in April of 2003. At that time in my life I craved for information. 

When I was 19, I moved to San Jose, CA to complete a two year volunteer mission for my church. I moved around quite a lot, but spent a fair amount of time in San Jose, Santa Clara and Cupertino. When I lived in Cupertino I lived only a few blocks form Apple's campus at 1 Infinite Loop. I was thrust into tech culture and all that entailed. I would often joke that there wasn't a person in the Bay Area that DIDN'T work in tech. It was a far cry from my life in Louisiana.

I left San Jose, went to college in Idaho, and then moved to Austin, Tx for a job with the Austin Police Department. After working there for five years, and with technology everpresently on my mind, I got sick and had to take some time off work. During my leave period I began to think about my past, my future, and goals I wanted for myself. One of the goals I wanted was some extra freedom that my current career didn't allow ie the ability to move around the country and the world if needed. When I decided on software development as my next step in life I realized quickly that this has been a long time coming. I understand what has brought me here and I look forward to where it takes me.
