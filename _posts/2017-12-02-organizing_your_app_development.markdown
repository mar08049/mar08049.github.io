After being in the Flatiron School Web Development course for four months now, I have not only grown in my knowledge and understanding of the curriculum but also in how I organize my tasks when I begin a big project. With the start of my rails project, I tried a new strategy. I created the skeleton of my app and then started by going through the lessons, one by one, and implementing what I learned into my app. This allowed me the opportunity to relearn the material, especially the topics that weren't clear to me, but also helped me implement one function at a time and not bounce around my app not knowing where to begin. 

Another way I have learned to organize my tasks is by creating a notes.md file where I organize my thoughts. That file looks something like this:

```
*Progress*
Welcome/Application  O
Login                O
Signup               O
User/:id             O
User creates trip    O
User/:id shows trips O
User/:id edits trips O
User/:id delete tripsO
Can add places to tr O
Can edit places      O
Can delete places    O
See all adventures   O
Logout               O

O = completed
*Current Problems*
Can't create, edit or delete places.
Cannot list ONLY "current_uses's" places.all.

```

I started by drawing a diagram on paper, which I later transfered to a file in my directory. This allows me to see my tasks and check them off as they are completed. This also helps me to see where to start when I leave my project for a time. I can see what problems are of highest importance. Reviewing previous lessons and creating a notes.md file have helped me organize my projects and I feel as though it can help others organize their time as well.
