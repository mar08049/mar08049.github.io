This project went much smoother than my CLI application I create a month ago. As an avid traveler, I initially decided to do an app called Backpacker Wars. It would keep a running list of all the countries you had visited. I even wanted to add a Leaderboard page that would list all the users by how many countries they had visited. I soon realized that the idea was just a step or two beyond my current skill level. I then changed my app to a packing list app called "Prepared Backpacker" which kept a list of gear you wanted to take with you on your next backpacking trip. It even provided links to packing lists other people had made for different areas of the world. I learned a lot from my failure to complete my Backpacker Wars app. For one, pushing myself to do something I didn't have the ability to do made my Prepared Backpacker app easier. I learned so much in failure. I also know that if i try the Backpacker Wars app in the future, I have the confidence to take it on and finish it. I might even use it for a future project. I learned important lessons through this section of the class that relates, I think, to my future career in programming: Get help from those around you, and its okay to fail...fail, learn then grow.
