The first thing that stood out to me when reviewing the curriculum for the Flatiron School was that Javascript is one of the last sections. As I already had some experience with basic HTML/CSS and Javascript this surprised me. It seems to me that you would want to have at least have a basic understanding of those topics before moving on to more advanced topics. The longer I go along the more I realize that everything in the curriculum is by design. We start by getting a basic understanding of Ruby, which will by in large be what we will be building our projects in. We then have HTML/CSS and get it out of the way. We then delve deeper into Ruby and master the intermediate concepts of the language.

We learn Sinatra before we learn Rails. This is by design. Sinatra is widely considered more advanced than Rails. We learn it first, I presume, to stretch our understanding and to make Rails much easier to grasp. I am currently working in Sinatra and I'm figuring it out. Because I'm understanding it, I feel confident I can grasp Rails. After Rails comes Javascript, because of my understanding of Ruby, I feel confident in my ability to grasp basic and intermediate JS. This isn't your average coding bootcamp, and it isn't supposed to be. Its much more than that. It is preparing us to be Junior Developers by reversing how we learn.
