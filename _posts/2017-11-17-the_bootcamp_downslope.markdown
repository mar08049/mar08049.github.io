As someone who is very right brained, so I often tend to think of things visually. I've realized that starting my Rails Project represents the start of my bootcamp downslope. Even though I am much more than half way through the curriculum, I have realized that all the easy topics are behind me. Even though, it was only two months ago when I was flying through HTML/CSS, it feels like just yesterday I was learning about div's and floating. Students that are just starting the program message me and ask me questions about iteration. I remember iteration being the hardest concept to grasp and now this student compliments me on my understanding of the topic. I have a lot to learn but never imagined I'd be here. It is literally like drinking through a waterhose.

The hard work isn't over. Javascript leads to React and then Redux. It only get's harder from here.

The subject matter gets harder and the assessments get much harder. This is real life. Flatiron is preparing me to enter the dog eat dog world of the tech industry. If it wasn't getting hard by now, they wouldn't be doing their jobs. Just as I once thought iteration was impossible, the same will happen with topics I'm learning and ones I learn in the future. I look forward to my future successes and intend to continually learn more; but for me and this curriculum, it feels good to be on the downslope.
