I finished the Flatiron curriculum in February. Since then, I have spent 10 days in Bali, moved across the country to DC, and spent over forty hours a week working to pay the bills. What has gotten lost occasionally in the last 3 months has been making time to code every day. When I was in the middle of the Flatiron program, I thought about code day and night; even in my dreams. I thought about how I would solve a problem that I was having, sometimes to the point of stopping everything I was doing or even waking up out of my sleep to whip out my laptop and test my idea. Now that Flatiron is no longer the center of my life, the dreams have stopped coming as often and I stop getting as many creative ideas all together. 

This brings me to the point of this post. If you want to become a better developer, you have to code, code, code. Coding is very much like riding a bicicle, sure you won't forget the concepts and theory but it is very easy to lose the muscle memory; forget the syntax or the terminal commands. This can happen after only a few weeks if not for constant practice. It is incredibly important to code nearly every day if you want to be the best developer you can be and one that is constantly growing.
