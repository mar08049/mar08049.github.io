This has been by far my most difficult project to date.  One thing that has made it harder is that I feel like there are less resources on the topic inside and outside of Flatiron School. I found several helpful videos on Youtube and one by a Flatiron instructor, but this project required a lot of independence and a lot of hard work. Another thing that made it difficult was that past students that I have received help from before, did their projects in Angular. In past projects I enlisted the help of past students who help me work through things but they are just as lost with React as I have been. Just as with all other projects, I feel that I really learned the material as I fought through completing the project, not from the lessons or labs. 

The end of this project marks my end of my time at Flatiron school as a student and the beginning of my job search which, if I'm being honest, I'm pretty nervous about. I have seen the statistics and know my chances are good. I do not feel ready but there was a time when I wasn't comprehending Object Oriented programming. Now I'm answer what I would call simple questions for other students who are now in my shoes. I know that in time I will feel more and more confident in my abilities as a web developer. I look forward to what is just the start of my journey.
