I had been cruising until a couple of weeks ago. Procedural ruby, HTML, CSS...I flew through it without many problems. I saw students get stuck on topics I found simple. Then came object oriented Ruby, and more specifically Scraping and CLI applications. I went from completing 20 lessons and labs a day to completing two a day and sometimes less. This CLI Gem Project has been my Achilles Heal. As I watch other students pass me, I realize that this will not always be easy and some topics will be more difficult than others to different people. 

The last two days, this lab has started to click some for me, as I've gone through past lessons and delved deeper into each topic. I have relied on, Google, Youtube and Github to get me to this point in the lab and I'm 90% finished. I have begun somewhat to understand scraper and I feel like my CLI is complete or as good as it is going to be without further direction during my assessment. There are things that I am missing I am sure, but what the last few weeks has taught me is that it is okay. Web development is a community where we help each other. I have helped many students when they were stuck on CSS or more basic ruby and now it is my turn to get help from others.
