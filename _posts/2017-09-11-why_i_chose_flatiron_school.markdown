When I first decided that I wanted to get into web development, the images I had were sitting in a chic office space in downtown Austin surrounded by other eager students who wanted to learn to code. When I began my search for a bootcamp, online wasn't even a thought for me. I felt like I worked better being surrounded by other students. For that reason, Flatiron was not on my initial list. I interviewed with several schools including Iron Yard who offered me admission to their program. Unfortunately, only a few days after I got my "acceptance" email, I learned that there were ending operations all all over their campuses nationwide. Disheartened, I thought breifly that maybe this path wasn't right for me. No other Austin based company felt as right to me. 

I expanded my search to online programs and stumbled across Flatiron School. I had seen the name before on Switchup.com and knew that Flatiron had a good reputation among former students. I decided to delve deeper. What stood out to me most from the beginning was the impressive hiring placement percentage. This is an important aspect; its why we are all here right? Not only are the numbers impressive, but I found it impressive that Flatiron School gets their placement numbers audited by an outside agency. I got interviewed by a recruiting specialist and was completely won over. I took the free online Web Development class and liked how easy it was to get help and guidence through the whole process. What I've learned since beginning the program is that even though I don't have student's physically next to me at a desk, I have a network of students that are just a click of a mouse away when I need them. I look forward to what the rest of this experience brings me.
