<p>Raised in Louisiana I was not taught about technology growing up. I felt like we were 5 years behind everyone else. I moved to San Jose, California and had the opposite experience. Everyone lives and breaths technology on a daily basis. I became a police officer in 2011 and moved to Austin, TX. After several years of serving, I decided that I was not totally fulfilled and have looked for other options. The path that stood out to me was web development; a seed that was planted in me all those years ago in Silicone Valley.</p>
